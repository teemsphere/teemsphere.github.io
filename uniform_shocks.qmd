# Uniform shocks

## Overview
The `"uniform"` shock type via `ems_shock()` allows for a homogenous shock over an entire variable or variable elements (using `...`) at a single specified `"value"` which represents a percentage change applied to the specified variable `"var"`.

## Full variable uniform shocks
The most simple uniform shock is applied to a full variable, meaning that all combinations of sets associated with that variable are allocated the same exogenous value. In the example below all regions (as determined by selected region mappings) will by increased by 1%.
```r
pop_shk <- ems_shock(var = "pop",
                     type = "uniform",
                     value = 1
)
```
[Here](https://github.com/teemsphere/teems-scripts/blob/main/GTAP-REv1/v11_uni_fullvar_shk.R) is an example of the usage above.
Numeraire shocks (in static models) can be carried out using a uniform shock:
```r
pfact_shk <- ems_shock(var = "pfactwld",
                       type = "uniform",
                       value = 2
)
```
## Partial variable uniform shocks
As with the syntax regarding swaps (link), the scope of a uniform shock may be determined by specifying elements within the sets associated with the shocked variable. For example, if we have a region "chn" and wish to allocate a shock specifically to this region:
```r
pop_shk <- ems_shock(var = "pop",
                     type = "uniform",
                     REGr = "chn",
                     value = 1
)
```
[Here](https://github.com/teemsphere/teems-scripts/blob/main/GTAP-REv1/v11_uni_partvar_shk_partswap.R) is an example of a partial variable swap followed by a partial variable uniform shock. If a full swap is followed by a partial variable shock ([example](https://github.com/teemsphere/teems-scripts/blob/main/GTAP-REv1/v11_uni_partvar_shk_fullswap.R)), the unshocked elements will remain at 0.

In the case of intertemporal models, the shock year may be specified using a chronological or timestep format (see "Time step summary" output from `ems_data()`).
```r
aoall_shk <- ems_shock(
  var = "aoall",
  type = "uniform",
  REGr = "asia",
  Year = 2019,
  ACTSa = "crops",
  value = -3
)
```
[Here](https://github.com/teemsphere/teems-scripts/blob/main/GTAP-REv1/v11_uni_partvar_year_shk.R) is an full example using chronological formats and a uniform shock.
***Note that sets specified in this manner are identified by the model-specific concatenation of the standard set name plus the variable-specific index.*** Also note that exogenous components of a variable not allocated a shock (all other regions except "chn") will not vary. Multiple elements may also be specified to allocated a single shock value to multiple elements:
```r
pop_shk <- ems_shock(var = "pop",
                     type = "uniform",
                     REGr = c("chn", "hkg"),
                     value = 1.5
)
```
