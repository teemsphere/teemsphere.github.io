# The Tablo file {#tab_files}

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = fs::dir_create(tempfile()))
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE, comment = "#>", eval = TRUE)
options(crayon.enabled = FALSE)
```

The TEEMS solver was originally designed as a GEMPack emulator and we have no intention of attempting to reproduce the thorough [GEMPack documentation](https://www.copsmodels.com/gpmanual.htm) on the Tablo scripting language and underlying solution software. *Most* Tablo model files (.tab) that work with GEMPack will also work with the TEEMS solver however there are a range of newer GEMPack features that are not compatible and are not likely to be incorporated. Fortunately there are workarounds for the vast majority as described below.

## Incompatible features

## Variable omissions
