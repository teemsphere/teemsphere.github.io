# Scenario shocks

## Overview
The `"scenario"` shock type via `ems_shock()` is a dedicated intertemporal shock type that allows for granular control over heterogenous shocks allocated on a tuple-specific basis, inputted as a CSV file or dataframe (or dataframe equivalent) through `"input"` in the form of absolute values. This is in contrast with custom shocks where the inputs are denominated in percentage change values.

## Using scenario shocks
Scenario shocks differ from custom shocks in a number of respects:

1. Only available for intertemporal models

2. Inputs must contain all *preaggregation* tuples associated with a variable

3. Inputs must span all elements (no partial variable scenario shock)

4. Inputs are denominated in actual values (e.g., million USD)

5. The input dataframe or CSV must contain one column "Year", corresponding to the chronological year for a shock in a specific tuple

There are several applications where it is advantageous to use scenario shock rather than a custom shock. The primary advantage is that scenario shocks allow for seamless changes to model aggregations since the shocks themselves are subject to mappings and aggregation. If we have trajectories available for all tuples within a given variable, a scenario shock will adjust to set mapping inputs in `ems_data()`. The actual values provided do not necessarily need to correspond to realworld values. We could for example use the integer 1 as a base and vary our components according to this base value in the year corresponding to t0.

## Population trajectory example
[Here](https://github.com/teemsphere/teems-scripts/blob/main/GTAP-REv1/v11_scn.R) is an example that takes base year population data from the GTAP database (typically not read into the model) and constructs hypothetical pathways for every region in the model. These pathways are valid for any regional aggregation chosen.
