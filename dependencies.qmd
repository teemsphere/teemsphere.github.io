This chapter outlines what is needed to run your first CGE model.
Ideally all components would be open-source and maybe one day they will be but for the moment there are still some minor hurdles to overcome.
Before beginning to write model scripts in [R](https://www.r-project.org/) with [`teems`](https://github.com/teemsphere/teems-R), users will need to gain access to a GTAP database and build the [teems-solver](https://github.com/teemsphere/teems-solver).
[GEMPack](https://www.copsmodels.com/gempack.htm) users can skip the solver step although they will be missing out on a considerable degree of functionality both within the solution process itself as well as regarding post-model data availability.
For those skeptical of using R or under the impression that R is only for statistical analysis, we would invite you to investigate speed tests between the R [data.table](https://r-datatable.com/) package (widely employed within [`teems`](https://github.com/teemsphere/teems-R)) and comparable packages in [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Julia](https://julialang.org/).

## Data
Currently the only data for teems-compatible CGE model runs is available from the Global Trade Analysis Project [(GTAP)](https://www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/).
Although the most recent databases are proprietary, GTAP has consistently open-accessed databases two versions out (GTAP 9 database as of the current GTAP 11 release).
In order to access the freely available database, users will need to [register](https://www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/access_member/profile/profile_addnew.aspx) with GTAP and download the "FlexAgg" format.
For GTAP 9 this is accessible under the "GDyn 9 Data Base for 2011" subheader in the "Satellite Data and Utilities" section [here](https://www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/databases/archives.asp).
For GTAP members that have purchased a database, the current [`teems`](https://github.com/teemsphere/teems-R) version is capable of handling the "FlexAgg" format for GTAP Databases 10 and 11.

## teems-R package
The R [package](https://github.com/teemsphere/teems-R) is currently in beta and open for testing.
Installation is via [remotes](https://github.com/r-lib/remotes) and instructions can be found here: [teems](https://github.com/teemsphere/teems-R).

## teems-solver
[`teems`](https://github.com/teemsphere/teems-R) calls Docker in order to solve the constrained optimization problem using low-level C and Fortran routines.
For those unable to use Docker, Singularity-based containerization will be made available in future releases.
The solver build is available here: [teems-solver](https://github.com/teemsphere/teems-solver).
