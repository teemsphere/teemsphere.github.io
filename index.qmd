# Introduction {#intro}
Reproducibility within computable general equilibrium (CGE) and partial equilibrium modelling analyses has long been elusive, in part due to proprietary data and software.
Here we address one aspect of this equation with the introduction of the TEEMS (Trade and Environment Equilibrium Modelling System) open-source software suite.

At its core, TEEMS comprises an R package [`teems`](https://github.com/teemsphere/teems-R) used to compose model runs and [teems-solver](https://github.com/teemsphere/teems-solver), a C-based solver capable of solving a large system of nonlinear equations by leveraging a range of mathematical and scientific computation libraries.
Auxiliary repositories to facilitate model runs also include [teems-models](https://github.com/teemsphere/teems-models), containing internally available and immediately compatible models, and [teems-mappings](https://github.com/teemsphere/teems-mappings).

The above tools working in conjunction allow for open and modular CGE model runs from head to tail as well as completely reproducible workflows.
With a base within the general purpose R scripting language, users able to seamlessly adjust model components including set aggregations, parameter weighting, closure and shock specifications as well as a large number of options pertaining to the solution and model outputs.
Model scripts can then be shared with colleagues, reviewers, and policy-makers for vetting, modification, and reproduction.

## Motivation
Reproducibility has been elusive in large part due to the proprietary nature of associated software and data for CGE modelling but also due to the shear complexity of compiling a single model run. A single "simple" model run for example *broadly* involves:

1. Data and set selection
2. Set mappings
3. Model selection
4. Variable omission
5. Closure selection including any swaps
6. Shock designation
7. Set-specific basedata loading, modification, and aggregation
8. Set- and weight-specific parameter loading, modification, and aggregation
7. Selection of matrix solution methods
8. Number of step and subinterval designations
9. Constrained optimization solution
10. Composition of all outputs into structured data

Indeed, in the course of building the TEEMS framework we have found that without a reproducible architecture, there is a very high possibility of persistent logic errors propagating through to the output without any obvious indications that this is taking place.

Models which incorporate time steps and additional auxiliary data (e.g., land-use data) or are coupled with other models such as is the case with most integrated assessment models (IAMs) are even more complex and more susceptable to a wide range of errors.

Ultimately we hope that this software mitigates the steep learning curve requisite to running equilibrium models and allows scientists from various disciplines to advance model representation of their fields.
The TLDR -- running a CGE model does not have to be so hard!

## Errors and model compatibility
This software suite has been under development for many years.
Despite our best efforts, it is possible that you will encounter issues -- particularly given the wide range of Tablo model files that exist in this field.
We are providing access in this current beta stage to crowdsource your efforts and address any significant issues before submitting the package to CRAN.
If your model file does not work, please get in touch and we will seek to expand compatibility.
