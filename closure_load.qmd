# Loading closures

## Overview
Closures are either inferred from the use of an internal Tablo file or inputted to the `closure_file` argument of `ems_deploy()`.

## Closure selection
If an internally supported Tablo file is chosen and no closure file specified, a standard model-specific closure will be used. These are available within the model repository: [teems-models](https://github.com/teemsphere/teems-models). The general format consistens of:
1. Character string "exogenous"
2. A "\n" delimited list of exogenous variables
3. ";"
4. "rest exogenous"
5. ";"

For example the standard closure for [GTAP-RE](https://github.com/teemsphere/teems-models/tree/main/GTAP-REv1) is as follows:
```
exogenous
afall
afcom
afeall
afecom
afereg
afesec

aintall
aintreg

aoreg

Note that no other operations (e.g., swaps) are to be listed witin the closure file. See swaps for instructions ...

Closure files can be explitly loaded as a ".cls" file within the `ems_deploy()` function.
```r
ems_deploy(data = data,
           model = model,
           closure_file = "path/to/usr_cls.cls")
```
