    "text": "1 Introduction\nReproducibility within computable general equilibrium (CGE) and partial equilibrium modelling analyses has long been elusive. Here we present TEEMS (Trade and Environment Equilibrium Modelling System), a set of tools which includes the R package teems used to compose model runs and teems-solver, a C-based solver capable of solving a large system of nonlinear equations by leveraging a range of mathematical and scientific computation libraries. Auxillary repositories include teems-models, containing internally available and immediately compatible models, teems-mappings with set mappings and teems-scripts which showcases a wide variety of model configurations and options.\nTogether these components allow for an open and modular pipeline software platform which handles all aspects of an equilibrium model run from head to tail through reproducible workflows that allows the user to seamlessly adjust model components including set aggregations, parameter weighting, closure and shock specifications as well as a large number of options pertaining to the solution and model outputs.",

    "text": "1.1 Motivation\nReproducibility has been elusive in large part due to the proprietary nature of associated software and data for CGE modelling but also due to the shear complexity of compiling a single model run. A single “simple” model run for example broadly involves:\n\nData and set selection\nSet mappings\nModel selection\nVariable omission\nClosure selection including any swaps\nShock designation\nSet-specific basedata loading, modification, and aggregation\nSet- and weight-specific parameter loading, modification, and aggregation\nSelection of matrix solution methods\nNumber of step and subinterval designations\nConstrained optimization solution\nComposition of all outputs into structured data\n\nIndeed, in the course of building the TEEMS framework we have found that without a reproducible architecture, there is a very high possibility of persistent logic errors propagating through to the output without any obvious indications that this is taking place in most cases. Models which incorporate time steps and additional auxillary data (e.g., land-use data) or are coupled with other models such as is the case with most integrated assessment models (IAMs) are even more complex, and therefore susceptable to a wide range of errors. Ultimately we hope that this software mitigates the steep learning curve requisite to running equilibrium models and allows scientists from various disciplines to advance model representation of their fields. The TLDR – running a CGE model does not have to be so hard!\nFinally, in addition to their proprietary nature, existing software for running CGE models relies upon graphical user interfaces which although convenient, poses a barrier to greater adoption by non-specialists as well as severely restricts the available range of tools due to the absence of a flourishing ecosystem such as that which can be found within more widely adopted scripting languages such as R.",

    "text": "2.1 Data\nThis chapter outlines what is needed to run your first CGE model. Ideally all components would be open-source and maybe one day they will be but for the moment there are still some minor hurdles to overcome. Before beginning to write model scripts with [teems], users will need to download data and build the TEEMS solver. GEMPack users can skip the solver step although they will be missing out on a considerable degree of functionality both within the solution process itself as well as regarding post-model data availability.\nCurrently the only data for teems-compatible CGE model runs is available from the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP)GTAP. Although the most recent databases are proprietary, GTAP has consistently open-accessed databases two versions out (GTAP 9 database as of the current GTAP 11 release). In order to access the freely available database, users will need to register with GTAP and download the “FlexAgg” format. For GTAP 9 this is accessible under the “GDyn 9 Data Base for 2011” subheader in the “Satellite Data and Utilities” section here. For paying GTAP members, the current [teems] version is capable of handling the “FlexAgg” format for GTAP Databases 10 and 11.",
