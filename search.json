    "text": "1 Introduction\nReproducibility within computable general equilibrium (CGE) and partial equilibrium modelling analyses has long been elusive, in part due to proprietary data and software. Here we address one aspect of this equation with the introduciton of the TEEMS (Trade and Environment Equilibrium Modelling System) open-source software suite. At its core, TEEMS comprises an R package teems used to compose model runs and teems-solver, a C-based solver capable of solving a large system of nonlinear equations by leveraging a range of mathematical and scientific computation libraries. Auxillary repositories to facilitate model runs also include teems-models, containing internally available and immediately compatible models, teems-mappings with set mappings and teems-scripts which showcases a wide variety of model configurations and options.\nThese tools working in conjunction allow for open and modular CGE model runs from head to tail as well as completely reproducible workflows. With a base within the general purpose R scripting language, users able to seamlessly adjust model components including set aggregations, parameter weighting, closure and shock specifications as well as a large number of options pertaining to the solution and model outputs. These model scripts (see e.g., teems-scripts) can then be shared with colleagues, reviewers, and policy-makers for vetting, modification, and reproduction.",

    "text": "1.1 Motivation\nReproducibility has been elusive in large part due to the proprietary nature of associated software and data for CGE modelling but also due to the shear complexity of compiling a single model run. A single “simple” model run for example broadly involves:\n\nData and set selection\nSet mappings\nModel selection\nVariable omission\nClosure selection including any swaps\nShock designation\nSet-specific basedata loading, modification, and aggregation\nSet- and weight-specific parameter loading, modification, and aggregation\nSelection of matrix solution methods\nNumber of step and subinterval designations\nConstrained optimization solution\nComposition of all outputs into structured data\n\nIndeed, in the course of building the TEEMS framework we have found that without a reproducible architecture, there is a very high possibility of persistent logic errors propagating through to the output without any obvious indications that this is taking place in most cases. Models which incorporate time steps and additional auxillary data (e.g., land-use data) or are coupled with other models such as is the case with most integrated assessment models (IAMs) are even more complex, and therefore susceptable to a wide range of errors. Ultimately we hope that this software mitigates the steep learning curve requisite to running equilibrium models and allows scientists from various disciplines to advance model representation of their fields. The TLDR – running a CGE model does not have to be so hard!",

    "text": "2.1 Data\nThis chapter outlines what is needed to run your first CGE model. Ideally all components would be open-source and maybe one day they will be but for the moment there are still some minor hurdles to overcome. Before beginning to write model scripts in R with teems, users will need to gain access to a GTAP database and build the teems-solver. GEMPack users can skip the solver step although they will be missing out on a considerable degree of functionality both within the solution process itself as well as regarding post-model data availability. For those skeptical of using R or under the impression that R is only for statistical analysis, we would invite you to investigate speed tests between the R data.table package (widely employed within teems) and comparable packages in Python and Julia.\nCurrently the only data for teems-compatible CGE model runs is available from the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP). Although the most recent databases are proprietary, GTAP has consistently open-accessed databases two versions out (GTAP 9 database as of the current GTAP 11 release). In order to access the freely available database, users will need to register with GTAP and download the “FlexAgg” format. For GTAP 9 this is accessible under the “GDyn 9 Data Base for 2011” subheader in the “Satellite Data and Utilities” section here.

For example, the region set below requires a set mapping to be loaded:\nSet\n    REG # regions #\n    read elements from file GTAPSETS header \"REG\";\nwhile the non-margin set below is constructed from sets previous declared (read-in in the case of the standard GTAPv7.0) and therefore requires no mapping.\nSet\n    NMRG # non-margin commodities # = COMM - MARG;\nteems ships with a number of set mappings for read-in sets ranging in size and focus. These internal mappings may be immediately utilized or a user may input their own mapping. Internal mappings are identified by the absence of a “.csv” file extension and inputted as a character string. Internal region mappings are as follows with the AR5, WB7, and WB23 derived from the countrycode R package - (ar5, region, and region23 respectively).\n\nregion (e.g., REG)\n\nbig3 (China, United States, ROW)\nAR5 (IPCC Fifth Assessment Report)\nWB7 (World Bank 7 region)\nWB23 (World Bank 23 region)\nR32 (IIASA-based 32 region SSP mapping)\nmedium\nlarge\nfull\n\n\nInternal sector mappings are according to the following focuses and number of elements:\n\nsector (e.g., TRAD_COMM, COMM, ACTS)\n\nmacro_sector\nagriculture\nmanufacturing\nservices\nmedium\nfull\n\n\nThe set names used in ... depend on the data format.

The auxiliary data must have the same dimensions and include all elements found in the original data. For example, providing a modified POP header replaces the population data loaded from the basedata HAR file.\nNovel headers introduce data not present in the original database. The set columns of the data frame are matched against sets loaded from the set input file. If a column name exactly matches a loaded set, its elements are validated. If the column name does not match but its elements are a subset of a known set, teems will issue a warning and rename the dimension accordingly.",

    "text": "5.1 Incompatible features\nThe teems-solver was originally designed as a GEMPack emulator and we have no intention of attempting to reproduce the very thorough GEMPack documentation on the Tablo scripting language and underlying solution software. Most Tablo model files (.tab) that work with GEMPack will also work with the teems-solver with some minor modifications. There are however a range of newer GEMPack features that are not compatible and are not likely to be incorporated. Fortunately there are workarounds for the vast majority as described below.\nConsiderable efforts have been made to correctly parse Tablo files but it is likely that custom Tablo files will need to be modified. If you find an incompatibility not listed here and feel that it should be addressed, please feel free to contact us with your model file. Some of the more frequent incompatibilities and workarounds are listed here.\n\n5.1.1 Supported Tablo statements\nThe parser recognizes the following Tablo statements: File, Coefficient, Read, Update, Set, Subset, Formula, Assertion, Variable, Equation, Write, and Zerodivide. Statements not in this list are either unsupported (e.g., Omit, raising an error) or ignored (Postsim, raising a warning).\n\n\n5.1.2 Set and subset declarations\nMultiple + or - operators within a single declaration are not supported. Instead of\nSet A123 = A1 + A2 + A3;\nUse\nSet A12 = A1 + A1;\nSet A123 = A12 + A3;\nIdentical set assignment without a Read statement is not supported. Instead of\nSet A # example set A # maximum size 5 read elements from file GTAPSETS header \"H2\";\nSet B # example set # = Set A;\nUse\nSet A # example set A # maximum size 5 read elements from file GTAPSETS header \"H2\";\nSet B # example set B # maximum size 5 read elements from file GTAPSETS header \"H2\";\nBinary set switches using a colon within a Set definition is not supported. The SLUG coefficient is not used to identify sluggish endowments. Declare these sets explicitly or via set operations.\nInstead of\nSet ENDWM # mobile endowments # = (all,e,ENDW:ENDOWFLAG(e,\"mobile\") ne 0);\nDeclare sets explicitly within the Tablo file:\nSet ENDWM # mobile endowment # (capital, unsklab, sklab);\nNote that sets in the full form (all elements) and subsetted form (model-specific aggregations) can be loaded using ... with ems_model() and set with ems_aux().\nCapital goods The CGDS sector in v6.2 format models is renamed to zcgds by default due to R data.table C-locale sorting and preference for all set elements to be lowercase.\n\n\n5.1.3 Formulas and Equations\nNo IF statements in Formula or Equation RHS (use sets). Instead of\nFormula (all,c,COMM)(all,r,REG)\n    VCB(c,r) = VDB(c,r) + sum{d,REG, VXSB(c,r,d)} + IF[c in MARG, VST(c,r)];\nUse\nFormula (all,c,MARG)(all,r,REG)\n    VCB(c,r) = VDB(c,r) + sum{d,REG, VXSB(c,r,d)} + VST(c,r);\nFormula (all,c,NMRG)(all,r,REG)\n    VCB(c,r) = VDB(c,r) + sum{d,REG, VXSB(c,r,d)};",

The left-hand side (name) must correspond to a coefficient (not header) declared within the model input. Three input types are supported, with model “Read” and “Formula” declarations modified accordingly:\n\n5.3.1 Uniform numeric value\nA single numeric value can be assigned to a coefficient.

Instead here use a data frame with the appropriate sets to assign multiple heterogeneous values to a coefficient.\n\n\n5.3.2 Data frame\nA data frame (or data frame extension such as tibble or data.table) can be used to assign heterogeneous values across set combinations. The data frame must contain columns for each set index using the model-specific naming convention (set name + variable index, e.g., REGr, COMMc, ALLTIMEt) and a Value column.\n# Heterogeneous values for SUBPAR coefficient (Read-type)\nCOMMc &lt;- c(\"crops\", \"food\", \"livestock\", \"mnfcs\", \"svces\")\nREGr &lt;- c(\"usa\", \"chn\", \"row\")\nALLTIMEt &lt;- seq(0, 10)\n\nSUBPAR &lt;- expand.grid(\n  COMMc = COMMc,\n  REGr = REGr,\n  ALLTIMEt = ALLTIMEt\n)\nSUBPAR$Value &lt;- runif(nrow(SUBPAR))\n\nmodel &lt;- ems_model(\n  model_input = ems_example(\"GTAP_RE.tab\"),\n  closure_file = ems_example(\"GTAP_RE.cls\"),\n  SUBPAR = SUBPAR\n)\nThis works for both Read-type and Formula-type coefficients:\n# Heterogeneous values for CPHI coefficient (Formula-type)\nREGr &lt;- c(\"usa\", \"chn\", \"row\")\nALLTIMEt &lt;- seq(0, 10)\n\nCPHI &lt;- expand.grid(\n  REGr = REGr,\n  ALLTIMEt = ALLTIMEt\n)\nCPHI$Value &lt;- runif(nrow(CPHI))\n\nmodel &lt;- ems_model(\n  model_input = ems_example(\"GTAP_RE.tab\"),\n  closure_file = ems_example(\"GTAP_RE.cls\"),\n  CPHI = CPHI\n)\n\n\n5.3.3 CSV file\nA path to a CSV file can be used as an alternative to a data frame.

For example:\n\n\n\nSet\nIndex\nColumn name\n\n\n\n\nREG\nr\nREGr\n\n\nCOMM\nc\nCOMMc\n\n\nACTS\na\nACTSa\n\n\nENDW\ne\nENDWe\n\n\nALLTIME\nt\nALLTIMEt\n\n\n\nThis naming convention disambiguates variables that have multiple instances of the same set.

In the above example the full “qfd” and “yp” variables were made exogenous while the full “tfd” and “dppriv” variable become endogenous. Within the GTAPv7.0 model, “qfd” encompasses the “COMM”, “ACTS”, and “REG” sets:\nVariable (orig_level=VDFB)(all,c,COMM)(all,a,ACTS)(all,r,REG)\n    qfd(c,a,r) # demand for domestic commodity c by activity a in region r #;\nWhat if we wish to shock only certain parts of this variable (e.g., a region or commodity) and allow the remainder of the variable to endogenously adjust according to model equations? In this case we would swap on the parts of the variable that we will provide values to and leave the remainder. If, for example, we have a shock value for “asia” within “REG” and “crops” within “ACTS”, the following ems_swap() call will prepare this swap for input into the swap_in argument of ems_deploy():\nqfd_in &lt;- ems_swap(\n  var = \"qfd\",\n  REGr = \"asia\",\n  ACTSa = \"crops\"\n)\nHere is an example of a partial variable swap followed by a partial variable uniform shock. Note that sets specified in this manner are identified by the model-specific concatenation of the standard set name plus the variable-specific index. This is necessary because many variables contain multiple instances of the same set and none of the teems functions relies upon input entry order or order within the model to make distinctions. In this case the “qfd” set subindices are “c”, “a”, and “r”, yielding “COMMc”, “ACTSa”, and “REGr”. In order to retain a valid closure we also use the same approach to the outgoing variable “tfd”:\ntfd_out &lt;- ems_swap(\n  var = \"tfd\",\n  REGr = \"asia\",\n  ACTSa = \"crops\"\n)\nWhile the subindices for both variables are the same within GTAPv7.0, note that these may vary in some models such as GTAPv6.2 where the REG subindex is “s” for “qfd” and “r” for “tfd”. Both swaps may now be loaded within ems_deploy():\ncmf_path &lt;- ems_deploy(\n  data = data,\n  model = model,\n  swap_in = qfd_in,\n  swap_out = tfd_out\n)\nOr if additional full variable swaps are also desired, a list is used to load multiple swaps for each direction\ncmf_path &lt;- ems_deploy(\n  data = data,\n  model = model,\n  swap_in = list(qfd_in \"yp\"),\n  swap_out = list(tfd_out, \"dppriv\")\n)\nHere is an example of the approach above (mixed format swap inputs with uniform shocks). Finally, selection of multiple elements for each set will expand the swap to encompass all associated tuples. For example:\nqfd_in &lt;- ems_swap(\n  var = \"qfd\",\n  REGr = c(\"asia\", \"lam\"),\n  ACTSa = \"crops\"\n)\nis equivalent to loading\nqfd_in_1 &lt;- ems_swap(\n  var = \"qfd\",\n  REGr = \"asia\",\n  ACTSa = \"crops\"\n)\nand\nqfd_in_2 &lt;- ems_swap(\n  var = \"qfd\",\n  REGr = \"lam\",\n  ACTSa = \"crops\"\n)",

    "text": "7.3 Partial variable uniform shocks\nAs with the syntax regarding swaps (link), the scope of a uniform shock may be determined by specifying elements within the sets associated with the shocked variable.
